🫀 CVDStack: AI-Driven Cardiovascular Disease Prediction with Stacking Generative AI

Live App: cvdstack.streamlit.app

Repository: GitHub – HowardHNguyen/cvdstack

Creator: Dr. Howard Nguyen, PhD — Data Science & AI, Healthcare Analytics

💡 Overview

CVDStack is a full-stack Generative AI + Machine Learning platform that predicts cardiovascular disease risk with medical-grade accuracy.
Built as part of my doctoral dissertation — “Advancing Heart Failure Prediction: A Comparative Study of Traditional Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Stacking Generative AI Models” — this project demonstrates how stacked ensemble AI can outperform both classical ML and single deep-learning models in real-world healthcare data.

The model integrates Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GBM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) into a unified architecture, improving minority-class representation and predictive reliability.

🧠 Motivation

Heart disease remains the leading global cause of death, often driven by silent risk factors hidden in routine clinical data.
Traditional models capture linear relationships but miss subtle, nonlinear interactions.
CVDStack bridges this gap by generating balanced synthetic data (via GANs) and stacking multiple AI learners to achieve deeper, more interpretable insights.

⚙️ Features

🧬 Stacking Generative AI Model: Combines GAN + RF + GBM + CNN to enhance learning from imbalanced datasets.

📊 Predictive Dashboard: Real-time ROC AUC, accuracy, and precision/recall summaries.

🩺 Explainable AI: SHAP-based feature importance to identify clinical drivers (e.g., BMI, sysBP, totChol).

🧩 Data Balancing: SMOTE and CTGAN integration for minority-class synthesis.

💾 Scalable Pipeline: Handles datasets from 303 to 400 K records seamlessly.

🌐 Deployment: Live Streamlit app connected to GitHub root-level Python files (no sub-dirs).

🧩 Methodology

Data Engineering

Pre-processed demographic & clinical variables (sex, age, BP, cholesterol, glucose, BMI, smoking).

Handled class imbalance using SMOTE and GAN-based data augmentation.

Model Training

Trained Random Forest, GBM, XGBoost, CNN, and Generative AI models individually.

Integrated them via a Stacking Classifier meta-learner (Logistic Regression).

Calibrated predictions using Isotonic Regression to ensure probability reliability.

Evaluation & Validation

Cross-validation AUC ≈ 0.99, accuracy ≈ 0.97 on 400 K records.

Comparative experiments vs. Logistic Regression, RF, GBM, and CNN confirmed superiority.

Avoided overfitting via permutation testing and hold-out validation.

Deployment & Interpretation

Streamlit UI built with Plotly and matplotlib for visual diagnostics.

Displays model predictions, feature importance, and interactive threshold adjustment.
